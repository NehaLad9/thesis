title = {Measurement of the Solar Electron Neutrino Flux with the Homestake Chlorine Detector},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The Homestake Solar Neutrino Detector, based on the inverse beta-decay reaction νe +37Cl →37Ar + e-, has been measuring the flux of solar neutrinos since 1970. The experiment has operated in a stable manner throughout this time period. All aspects of this detector are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the determination of the extraction and counting efficiencies, the key experimental parameters that are necessary to convert the measured 37Ar count rate to the solar neutrino production rate. A thorough consideration is also given to the systematics of the detector, including the measurement of the extraction and counting efficiencies and the nonsolar production of 37Ar. The combined result of 108 extractions is a solar neutrino-induced 37Ar production rate of 2.56 ± 0.l6 (statistical) ± 0.16 (systematic) SNU.}

Part of the detector, NT-36, with 36 photomultiplier tubes at three strings, has been installed in 1993. This array allowed for the first time a three-dimensional mapping of Cherenkov light deep underwater. Since then, various arrays have been almost continuously taking data. Presently a 96-PMT array is operating. We describe the NT-200 detector design and present results obtained with NT-36.}

abstract = {AMANDA is a high-energy neutrino telescope presently under construction at the geographical South Pole. In the Antarctic summer 1995/96, an array of 80 optical modules (OMs) arranged on 4 strings (AMANDA-B4) was deployed at depths between 1.5 and 2 km. In this paper we describe the design and performance of the AMANDA-B4 prototype, based on data collected between February and November 1996. Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response to down-going atmospheric muon tracks show that the global behavior of the detector is understood. We describe the data analysis method and present first results on atmospheric muon reconstruction and separation of neutrino candidates. The AMANDA array was upgraded with 216 OMs on 6 new strings in 1996/97 (AMANDA-B10), and 122 additional OMs on 3 strings in 1997/98.}

It will host the next generation Cherenkov neutrino telescope and nodes for a deep sea multidisciplinary observatory, providing oceanographers, marine biologists, and geophysicists with real time measurements. The neutrino telescope will complement IceCube in its field of view and exceed it substantially in sensitivity. Its main goal is the detection of high energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin. The detector will have a modular structure with six building blocks, each consisting of about 100 Detection Units (DUs). Each DU will be equipped with 18 multi-PMT digital optical modules. The first phase of construction has started and shore and deep-sea infrastructures hosting the future KM3NeT detector are being prepared in offshore Toulon, France and offshore Capo Passero on Sicily, Italy. The technological solutions for the neutrino detector of KM3NeT and the expected performance of the neutrino telescope are presented and discussed.}
