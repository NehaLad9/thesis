\sidecite[-6cm]{PhysRevD.42.3613} and AMANDA \sidecite[-6cm]{ANDRES20001}, leading to the realization of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole \sidecite[-6cm]{Halzen:2010yj}. As a result of these advancements, the capabilities for neutrino detection have increased dramatically, allowing for the exploration of a broader range of astrophysical phenomena.

\textbf{The IceCube Neutrino Observatory} has achieved remarkable milestones since it started to operate fully since 2011, establishing itself as one of the most remarkable neutrino telescopes in the field of neutrino astronomy. Among its significant accomplishments is the discovery of astrophysical neutrinos, which marked a turning point in the field, confirming that high-energy neutrinos originate from cosmic sources rather than being solely produced in Earth's atmosphere \sidecite[-6cm]{Evidence_paper}. The observation of a correlation between high-energy neutrinos from the TXS 0506+056 blazar and its gamma-ray emission demonstrated the connection between different messenger particles \sidecite[-6cm]{txspaper,txspaper2}. Additionally, IceCube has made important contributions to the study of neutrinos from various sources, such as the sayfert galaxy NGC 1068 \sidecite[-6cm]{ngc1068} and also neutrinos from our own galaxy, Milky Way \sidecite[-6cm]{milkyway}. In addition to these sources, and discovery of the diffuse neutrino flux, IceCube has also been able to measure the features of the neutrino flux with striking accuracies via different event samples, that target various neutirno flavours \sidecite[-6cm]{cscd_6yr,diffusenumu,HESE7_sample, ESTES}. The most recent results, combining some of these data samples and another independent sample revealed a spectral break in the diffuse neutrino spectrum with >$4\sigma$ confidence \sidecite[-6cm]{globalfit_icrc, MESE_ICRC}. Such features in the spectrum, can help recognising what are the dominant sources at different energy ranges. Furthermore, IceCube has placed tight constraints on neutrino oscillation parameters by measuring atmospheric tau neutrino appearance \sidecite[-6cm]{IceCube_atm_numixing,IceCube:2024xjj} contributing to our understanding of fundamental particle interactions.
